# AES xtime() Differential Timing Attack

Developed as a module assignment @ The University of Birmingham (LH Security of Real World Systems)

**The aes executable and a part of the timing.py code has been supplied by the module staff.**

## To run the attack:
- python3 timing.py <br />
(will output the AES-128 key) <br />
**OR** <br />
- python3 timing_debugged.py <br />
(will output the AES-128 key with debugs along the way)
