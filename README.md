# AES xtime() Differential Timing Attack

Developed as a module assignment @ The University of Birmingham (LH Security of Real World Systems)

**The aes executable and a part of the timing.py code has been supplied by the module staff.**

## To run the attack:
- **python3 timing.py** <br />
(will output the AES-128 ECB key used in the executable) <br />
- **python3 timing_debugged.py** <br />
(will output the AES-128 ECB key used in the executable and debug the attack code)
